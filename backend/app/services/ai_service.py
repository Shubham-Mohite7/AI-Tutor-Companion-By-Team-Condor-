You are an expert educational content creator. Your task is to create a comprehensive learning module.

TASK 1 - EXPLANATION:
Write a detailed, multi-paragraph explanation of {topic} (minimum 300 words). Include:
- Definition and core concepts
- Historical context (if applicable)
- Key components or characteristics
- Practical applications or examples
- Importance or significance
- Common misconceptions or clarifications

TASK 2 - QUIZ QUESTIONS:
Create exactly 10 multiple choice questions that test understanding of the explanation. Each question must be:
- UNIQUE and test different aspects
- Answerable ONLY from the explanation provided
- Challenging but fair
- NOT simply repeating the topic name

CRITICAL RULES:
- NEVER ask "What is {topic}?" or "Who is {topic}?"
- NEVER repeat the exact topic wording in questions
- Questions must test comprehension, not just recognition
- Each question should focus on: definitions, examples, applications, comparisons, causes/effects, significance

QUESTION TYPES TO INCLUDE:
1. Definition question (but not "What is X?")
2. Application/example question
3. Comparison/contrast question  
4. Cause/effect question
5. Significance/importance question
6. Process/method question
7. Characteristic/component question
8. Context/historical question
9. Misconception question
10. Evaluation/analysis question

FORMAT EXACTLY:

EXPLANATION: [Your detailed 300+ word explanation with multiple paragraphs]

QUESTION 1: [Specific question testing understanding - NOT "What is/Who is topic"]
A) [Correct option from explanation]
B) [Plausible but incorrect option]
C) [Plausible but incorrect option] 
D) [Plausible but incorrect option]
CORRECT: A

QUESTION 2: [Different type of question]
A) [Correct option from explanation]
B) [Plausible but incorrect option]
C) [Plausible but incorrect option]
D) [Plausible but incorrect option]
CORRECT: B

When you study {topic}, you're not just learning facts - you're developing your mind and learning to think in new ways. {topic.title()} challenges you to look at things from different perspectives and make connections between ideas that might not seem related at first.

{topic.title()} has real-world applications that affect our daily lives, even if we don't always notice them. The principles and concepts in {topic} help us solve problems, make better decisions, and understand the world around us more deeply.

Learning about {topic} also teaches you valuable skills like critical thinking, problem-solving, and analysis. These skills are useful no matter what career or path you choose in life. Every expert in {topic} was once a beginner, just like you!

The beauty of {topic} is that it opens your mind to new possibilities and helps you see the world in a different way. Whether you're interested in science, art, technology, or any other field, understanding {topic} will enrich your knowledge and make you a more well-rounded person.

Remember, learning is a journey, not a destination. Every question you ask and every concept you master in {topic} builds a foundation for even greater understanding and discovery."""
